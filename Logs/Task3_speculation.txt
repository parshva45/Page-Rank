Comparing Top 10 pages based on number of in-links and PageRank
when traversed using BFS, the result may be so due to following points:

1) Top 2 pages i.e 'International_Standard_Book_Number' and 
'Digital_object_identifier' are the same for both results.
Because, they both have high number of in-links (413 and 330)
plus they are important too (As both of them
are linked from 8 out of the top 10 important pages).
A page becomes important if linked from other important pages.

2) The pages 'International_Standard_Serial_Number' and
'National_Diet_Library' make it to third position though they do
not have many number of in-links (not in top 10),
because they are linked from many other important pages (6/top 10)

3) The pages 'United_States', 'Bibcode' and 'Wayback_Machine' appear
at 5th, 6th, 7th places because they have links from some important
pages too plus they also belong to top 10 links according to number
of in-links (229, 228, 227).

4) The pages 'World_War_II', 'OCLC' and 'Canada' make it to top 10
but fall back to positions 8th, 9th, 10th respectively as they do not
have many in-links but are linked from some important pages.
(4, 3, 4 pages of the top 10 important pages)

5) The page 'Tropical_cyclone', though at position 3 on the basis of
number of in-links (308), couldn't make it to top 10 pages according to
PageRank because it is not linked from important pages.
'Tropical_cyclone' is linked only from 1 link among the top 10
important pages (just from 'United_States'). Similar is the case
for the page 'International_Space_Station' (just from 'Canada').

6) The pages 'National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration' and
'Pascal_(unit)' though are in top 10 pages based on number of in-links,
couldn't make it to top 10 pages based on PageRank as they are not linked
from any of the important pages.

Comparing Top 10 pages based on number of in-links and PageRank
when traversed using DFS, the result may be so due to following points:

1) The pages 'DMOZ' and 'PubMed_Central' may be important because of linking
from many other important pages, maybe many from top 50 pages
(both of them are linked by 3 out of 10 most important pages).

2) The pages 'International_Standard_Book_Number' and 'Digital_object_identifier'
are linked from 6 out of 10 most important pages, due to which they make up
to 2nd and 4th positions in the list.

3) All the pages from positions 5 to 10 are linked by 3 out of 10
most important pages, which helps them to make up to the top 10 list.

4) Pages like 'London_Underground', 'Transport_for_London' and
'National_Rail' also appear in both - the top 10 pages based on number of
in-links (716, 622, 535 respectively) and top 10 pages based on PageRank
(positions 7, 8, 10)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Observing the statistics of both G1 and G2, the pages which seem
most important (basically their intersection) are:
- 'International_Standard_Book_Number'
- 'Digital_object_identifier'
- 'World_War_II'

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

By comparing statistics for both G1 and G2, it can be said that
BFS crawling approach gives good corpus and the required page
can be get in most cases, but in case of DFS crawling we cannot ensure
good corpus. So we can say that BFS crawling gives better result of crawling.
